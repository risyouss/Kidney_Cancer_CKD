Enhancing Early Detection of Kidney Cancer with AI: Integrated Model Deployment for Tumor Detection and Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

Description: This project focuses on advancing early kidney cancer detection by deploying two integrated models within a single Flask-based web application. The first model utilizes EfficientNet CNN for precise tumor detection, achieving a remarkable 99.40% accuracy on the test set. The second model, designed for predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on blood test data, complements the tumor detection system. The combined application aims to offer a comprehensive solution for improved patient outcomes through early diagnosis and actionable insights.
